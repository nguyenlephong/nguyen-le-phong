# Code challenge

## To start and enjoy my code implement:

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine with the latest version, and have your preferred package manager ready (`bun` is recommended for its speed). If not, replace "bun" with the package manager available on your machine.
Follow these steps:
1. Run `bun install`
2. Run `bun start`
3. Open your web browser and navigate to `https://localhost:3000`

Now, you're ready to explore and enjoy my code implementation!

## Some concerns

During the development of the CurrencySwapForm, I encountered difficulties in its description. I wasn't sure about the specific formula for currency conversion, so there might be discrepancies in my calculations compared to the expectations of your team. However, please overlook this, as I understand the value of time for both parties involved. To expedite the process, I refrained from reaching out to your team. I appreciate your understanding regarding this matter.

Furthermore, I noticed that typically, to convert currencies, I need to know a standard conversion rate. It could be from LUNA to USDT, and then from USDT to BNB (this is just an example). Thus, we would need to have a pair for each field. However, I haven't seen a description for this part yet.

I have fulfilled the requirements for each section, but I acknowledge that it's not comprehensive. For instance, in the form validation section, I only implemented some basic points such as mandatory fields or ensuring values are not less than 0. I kept it very simple. If you need a more refined version, I am capable of doing so. However, I'm unsure what more is needed as there are numerous ideas I could implement for this.

Regarding the directory structure, it could indeed be much simpler, but I structured it to demonstrate that this project can be expanded and maintained without any concerns.

I have chosen to utilize some supporting libraries such as lodash and Ant Design. I just want you to know that I have used quite a few libraries, rather than solely relying on vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.

Thank you for considering these points.
