# Problem 3: Messy React

## Here are some computational inefficiencies and anti-patterns in the provided code block:

1. **Inefficient sorting and filtering:**
   - The `sortedBalances` useMemo hook filters balances based on a priority function and then sorts them. However, the priority function is called multiple times for each balance, leading to redundant computations.
   - **Improvement:** Instead of calling `getPriority` for each balance during filtering and sorting, calculate the priorities once and memoize them.

2. **Unnecessary re-renders:**
   - The `sortedBalances` useMemo hook depends solely on `balances` for filtering and sorting. Changes in `prices` won't affect the calculation of `sortedBalances`.
   - **Improvement:** No change is required in this case since `prices` don't impact the calculation of `sortedBalances`. The hook is appropriately set up to only recalculate when `balances` change, avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

3. **Missing dependency in useMemo:**
   - The `sortedBalances` useMemo hook should include prices in its dependency array because it relies on prices for sorting balances based on their USD values.
   - **Improvement:** Add prices to the dependency array of the useMemo hook.

4. **Inefficient use of HTML attributes:**
   - Attaching `{...rest}` props to HTML attributes may not have any effect and could lead to unintended behavior and warnings.
   - **Improvement:** Avoid attaching `{...rest}` props directly to HTML attributes to prevent issues.

5. **Logic separation:**
   - The `getPriority` function performs independent logic processing and doesn't involve UI tasks, violating the separation of concerns principle.
   - **Improvement:** Move the `getPriority` function outside of the UI component to ensure better separation of concerns.

6. **Key selection for mapping components:**
   - Using the index as the key when mapping components can lead to issues and incorrect rendering.
   - **Improvement:** Utilize a unique identifier or property from the data, such as an ID, as the key when mapping components to ensure proper DOM updates.

7. **Type inconsistency:**
   - The `WalletBalance` type lacks the `blockchain` property, yet it's extensively used within the `useMemo` hook.
   - **Improvement:** Ensure that the `WalletBalance` type includes the `blockchain` property or adjust its usage accordingly to prevent potential errors.

8. **Excessive hidden loops:**
   - There's unnecessary looping in the `formattedBalances` creation, which could be optimized by integrating it within the `useMemo` hook.
   - **Improvement:** Combine the logic for formatting balances within the `useMemo` hook to reduce unnecessary iterations.

9. **Missing variable declarations:**
   - Variables such as `classes`, `WalletRow` component, and `useWalletBalances`, `usePrices` hooks are used without being declared beforehand, leading to potential runtime errors.
   - **Improvement:** Ensure all necessary variables, components, and hooks are imported or declared before usage to prevent runtime errors.


10. **Incomplete condition:**
    - The `balances.filter` step lacks an else part for the `(balance.amount <= 0)` condition, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
    - **Improvement:** Provide an else condition to handle cases where balance amounts are greater than 0 for better code completeness and clarity.


11. **Switch case optimization:**
    - The switch case for blockchain priorities can be simplified by combining `Zilliqa` and `Neo`.
    - **Improvement:** Refactor the switch case to eliminate redundancy and enhance code readability.


## Here's a refactored version of the code addressing the mentioned issues:

```
import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

// Move getPriority function outside of the WalletPage component
const getPriority = (blockchain: string): number => {
  switch (blockchain) {
    case 'Osmosis':
      return 100;
    case 'Ethereum':
      return 50;
    case 'Arbitrum':
      return 30;
    case 'Zilliqa':
    case 'Neo': // Combine cases with same priority
      return 20;
    default:
      return -99;
  }
};

interface WalletBalance {
  currency: string;
  amount: number;
  blockchain: string; // Added missing blockchain property
}

interface FormattedWalletBalance extends WalletBalance {
  formatted: string;
}

interface WalletRowProps {
  amount: number;
  usdValue: number;
  formattedAmount: string;
}

const WalletRow: React.FC<WalletRowProps> = ({amount, usdValue, formattedAmount,}) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Render wallet row */}
    </div>
  );
};

interface Props extends BoxProps {}

const WalletPage: React.FC<Props> = ({ children, ...rest }: Props) => {
  const balances = useWalletBalances();
  const prices = usePrices();
  
  // Refactor: Combine filtering, sorting, and formatting logic into a single useMemo hook
  const formattedBalances = useMemo(() => {
    const prioritizedBalances = balances.map((balance) => ({
      ...balance,
      priority: getPriority(balance.blockchain), // Use getPriority function
      
      /**
       * In this case, merging the formatting logic into the useMemo hook when calculating prioritizedBalances doesn't violate the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
       * SRP suggests that each class or module should have only one responsibility.
       * However, here, calculating and formatting formattedBalances is also part of processing specific data within the WalletPage component.
       *
       * The reason for merging the formatting logic into the useMemo hook is to optimize computation.
       * By doing so, we avoid iterating over formattedBalances after computing prioritizedBalances.
       * This minimizes the number of loops, potentially improving performance, especially with large datasets,
       * and enhancing user experience by reducing processing and rendering time.
       *
       * Therefore, in this context, merging not only saves iterations
       * but also enhances overall application performance without violating the SOLID principles.
       */
      formatted: balance.amount.toFixed(), // Format balance amount
    }));
    
    // Filter balances based on priority and amount
    const filteredBalances = prioritizedBalances.filter(
      (balance) => balance.priority > -99 && balance.amount <= 0
    );
    
    // Sort balances by priority
    filteredBalances.sort((lhs, rhs) => rhs.priority - lhs.priority);
    
    return filteredBalances;
  }, [balances]);
  
  // Refactor: Use unique identifier as key instead of index
  const rows = formattedBalances.map((balance, index) => {
    const usdValue = prices[balance.currency] * balance.amount;
    return (
      <WalletRow
        className={classes.row}
        key={balance.currency} // Use currency as unique key
        amount={balance.amount}
        usdValue={usdValue}
        formattedAmount={balance.formatted}
      />
    );
  });
  
  // Note: Using `{...rest}` here may unintentionally pass props that HTML doesn't support,
  // leading to warnings or unexpected behavior. Consider declaring specific props instead.
  return <div {...rest}>{rows}</div>;
};
